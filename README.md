1. A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it.
2. A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment. 
3. data types- number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, object
eg: console.log('JavaScript');
console.log(2011);
console.log('Woohoo! I love to code! #codecademy');
console.log(20.49)
4. Arithmetic operators :
Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
Remainder: %
eg: console.log(21 + 3.5);
console.log(2022-1969);
console.log(65/240);
console.log(0.2708 * 100);
5. String concatination :
process of appending one string to another is called concatenation. 
6. Properties :
When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. All data types have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance.
eg : console.log('Teaching the world how to code'.length);
    length= 30
7. Methods : Remember that methods are actions we can perform. Data types have access to specific methods that allow us to handle instances of that data type. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

a period (the dot operator)
the name of the method
opening and closing parentheses
eg: console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());

8. Built-in Objects : In addition to console, there are other objects built into JavaScript. Down the line, you’ll build your own objects, but for now these “built-in” objects are full of useful functionality.

For example, if you wanted to perform more complex mathematical operations than arithmetic, JavaScript has the built-in Math object.

The great thing about objects is that they have methods! 
eg : console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
console.log(Math.ceil(43.8));
console.log(Number.isInteger(2017));

9.Variables : variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

Create a variable with a descriptive name.
Store or update information stored in a variable.
Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.
